# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".

#    Absolute: /Users/zekyang/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2
#    Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?

#     cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)

#     It removes the directory.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
# git commit
# git push
#     git add will add our file to the staging area to allow git to track the files.
#     git commit saves our files which are being tracked in the staging area to the local repository.
#     git push tells our local repository to save the changes to our remote repository as well.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?

#     git add . adds all available files, while git add <file> adds only the specified file.

#     Luckily, one of the instructors helped me out by running "exit<>" and that fixed the issue.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?

#     I don't really know how some of the commands work (like the one above), but I will figure it out with time.

#     Kazakhstan's capital holds the Guinness World Record for the capital city with the most name changes in modern times!

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 

print(1 + 1) #this adds the numbers, a fundamental mathematical concept which is critical to modern life as we know it. How cool is that!
